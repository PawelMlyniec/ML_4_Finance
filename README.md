## Abstract
This work tackles the problem of price prediction for swap transactions of cryptocurrencies
on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). We study
predictive abilities of two candidate machine
learning models: Linear Regression and Recurrent Neural Network on the task of price
prediction. We study six different cryptocurrencies pairs and examine models for ability to
predict next transaction prices in one-step and
autoregressive regime. Furthermore, we assess
predictive abilities of Linear Regression model
in coin pair agnostic setup, trying to create a
versatile, one fits them all model. We conclude
that price prediction is inherently difficult especially for long-term forecasting. Comparing
to a Na ̈ıve Baseline, Linear Regression model
managed to perform better on one-step prediction proving its short-term forecasting abilities
